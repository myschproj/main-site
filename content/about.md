## nickname

My nickname is **flexagoon**, written exactly like that. You cannot change any
letters or capitalize them in a different way. First letter **should not** be
capitalized, even if in the beginning of the sentence.

❌ Flexagoon  
❌ flexagon  
❌ FLEXOGON  
✅ flexagoon  

## font

This is not a hard requirement, however, my name should preferrably be written
in the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) font. More specifically, you should use
the **Extra Bold Italic** variant.

## logo

You can download my logo in three variants here. All three variants are in the
SVG format.

🔴 [Colored variant](/images/logo-color.svg)  
⚪ [White variant](/images/logo-white.svg)  
⚫ [Black variant](/images/logo-black.svg)

The white and black variants can be of course recolored to a different color
with any vector graphics editing program.
